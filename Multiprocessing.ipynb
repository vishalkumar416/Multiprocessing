    "# Multiprocessing in Python is a technique used to run multiple processes simultaneously, leveraging multiple CPU cores to perform tasks in parallel. Unlike multithreading, which has limitations due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), multiprocessing sidesteps these issues by creating separate memory spaces for each process.\n",
    "# Its uses :\n",
    "# 1) Performance Improvement: It can significantly improve performance for CPU-bound tasks by distributing the workload across multiple processors or cores.\n",
    "# 2) Avoiding GIL Limitations: Since each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, they are not restricted by the GIL, making multiprocessing ideal for tasks that need true parallelism.\n",
    "# 3) Handling Concurrent Tasks: Multiprocessing is useful for running concurrent tasks that are independent of each other, like data processing, web scraping, or simulations.\n",
